"""The git workspace the coder agent writes in, and the two tools it needs there.

Runs in the isolated coding environment, not in the ADK serving one -- see
``pyproject.toml`` in this directory for why they are separate.

Reading, editing and running commands are the Antigravity SDK's job -- see
``coder.py``. What is left here is everything the SDK has no opinion about:
getting a private repository onto disk at an exact commit, getting the work
back off again, and knowing how long is left.

Three stores, and the run needs all three:

* **Agent Platform Sessions** holds the reasoning across dispatches. It is what
  makes a second dispatch a continuation rather than a restart.
* **The branch** holds the code. It is the only durable artifact; the deadline
  can arrive at any moment and whatever is pushed is what survives.
* **This workspace** holds neither. ``/tmp`` is on the instance's overlay and
  does not outlive the invocation, so every dispatch rebuilds it.

Nothing here blocks the event loop: every subprocess goes through
``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec``.
