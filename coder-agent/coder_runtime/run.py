"""Entry point for the isolated coding environment.

Reads one job as JSON on stdin, streams NDJSON events on stdout, exits 0 even
when the coding run failed -- the failure is an event, not a crash. The parent
in ``app/coder_client.py`` is the only caller.

Keeping this a subprocess is not an aesthetic choice. ``google-antigravity``
needs protobuf >= 7.35 and ``google-cloud-aiplatform`` caps it below 7.0.0, so
the coding harness and the ADK serving surface cannot be imported into the same
interpreter. See ``coder_runtime/pyproject.toml``.
